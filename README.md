# Project IAM
### Zero-Touch Provisioning, Identity Lifecycle, & CIS 20 Compliance Automation
> Led the implementation of zero-touch provisioning to streamline
            device setup and deployment across the organization. Automated
            identity and account lifecycle management processes, including user
            onboarding, role-based access control, and deprovisioning. Ensured
            alignment with CIS Controls v8 (formerly CIS 20), enhancing the
            organizationâ€™s security posture and compliance readiness. This
            initiative significantly reduced manual IT workloads, minimized
            security risks, and improved operational efficiency.
